# Determinants of Health-Seeking Behavior in India

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) to identify the primary drivers of health-seeking behavior among women in India.

Using Logistic Regression and Feature Importance analysis, we predict the likelihood of a woman visiting a health facility (s368). The model challenges the traditional assumption that "Wealth" is the sole predictor of health access, revealing that Information Access (Media) and Intra-Household Dynamics play a more decisive role.
